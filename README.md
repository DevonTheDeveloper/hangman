## Description

A word game in which one player has to guess a word by guessing the letters in it.
## Technologies

For this project all I used was __***Ruby***__.
## What have I learnt?

In this project Iâ€™ve learnt a lot about being independent, and just googling things but also asking questions. 

I learnt how to serialize, and deserialize things and I understand how I can make my code more readable by splitting things into methods and modules.
## Roadmap

- [x]  Load & validate dictionary
- [x]  Fetch & validate guesses
- [x]  Display word progress & variables
- [x]  Declare wins and losses
- [x]  Save games with YAML
- [x]  Load games with YAML
